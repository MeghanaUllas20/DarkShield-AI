# 🛡️ DarkShield AI

## AI-Powered Dark Pattern Detection & Ethical UX Auditor

DarkShield AI is an intelligent platform designed to identify, analyze, and explain dark patterns used in websites and digital products. The system leverages Generative AI to detect manipulative user experience practices and provide ethical redesign recommendations.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Many websites use deceptive design techniques, commonly known as **Dark Patterns**, to influence user behavior. These patterns often pressure users into actions such as:

* Accepting unnecessary cookies
* Making unintended purchases
* Subscribing to unwanted services
* Sharing personal information
* Remaining trapped in difficult cancellation flows

Most users are unable to recognize these manipulative tactics.

DarkShield AI helps users, designers, and organizations identify such practices and promote ethical digital experiences.
